## [Wayback on Amazon](#wayback-on-amazon)

#### *Website Norms: Then and Now*
![Screen Shot 2025-01-24 at 2 46 03 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28747a2f-1a5b-4ea4-93c4-7abc68cb60a0)

<p>Using the Wayback Machine, I viewed the Amazon website from 2006. The differences between the older version of the site and the current one are blatantly clear, with the most distinct being the overall interface of the landing page. The older website featured a visually cluttered homepage that placed less emphasis on ease of navigation and more on presenting a high volume of information at once. Images were smaller and more sparse, with products advertised using simple hyperlinks attached to their names. Additionally, much of the text on the page lacked clear contrast, showing only subtle variations in size or color.</p>

Conversely, the current website presents clear and distinct categories on the homepage, making it easier for users to navigate to different areas of the site. Text size and style for headings, subheadings, and body text follow a cohesive yet clearly contrasted structure, creating a uniform interface. Although it can be somewhat visually overwhelming due to the large number of graphics and photos on the page, they are mostly presented in an organized and easy-to-navigate manner.
  
#### *A Difference in Functionality*

<p>While the older version of Amazon was generally functional, its format was practical to a fault and lacked the visually appealing nature that has become a necessity for modern websites. Although I wouldn’t call the appearance of older websites necessarily jarring, I would say that their antiquity is immediately obvious to the average internet user. Personally, I find something charming about the straightforward nature of the older Amazon website, though I can certainly appreciate how its design has improved over the last two decades.</p>

As a modern internet user, I think the most interesting part of visiting an older version of the Amazon website is how navigation-focused it is, with an endless wall of categories and hyperlinks to match. The website now feels much less cluttered in comparison and places a greater emphasis on actually displaying pictures of products, many of which are suggested based on your browsing. In today's world, websites are expected to be both functional and aesthetically appealing, so when they deviate from this, I think it can completely bar people from using them at all.

Slide the oval "on" switch forward to begin the boiling process. Water will boil in approximately 20-40 seconds, and the switch will automatically turn off once it’s ready.

#### 7. Pour water and enjoy.    
> [!CAUTION]
> Always ensure the kettle is placed securely on the base before use, and never exceed the maximum water level to prevent spills or overheating.



##  [Generative A.I. and Past Assignments](#generative-ai-and-past-assignments)

#### *Use any generative AI to generate an assignment (or some other piece of writing) that you have already completed. Share the prompt you used, the results you received, and a brief analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the software.*

For this reflection, I utilized ChatGPT to complete the Wayback assignment using the exact prompt we were given. Additionally, I asked that ChatGPT complete this prompt in a concise, short response. The results were the following:

> **"Observations**  
> Exploring an early version of Amazon through the Wayback Machine revealed a cluttered and text-heavy layout. The homepage featured long lists of categories with minimal imagery and poor contrast between text and background. Navigation was simple but overwhelming, with no clear structure or visual hierarchy.  
> **The Experience**  
> As a modern user, navigating this site was frustrating. It lacked the clean, intuitive design we expect today, and tasks like finding products were more challenging. There were no mobile optimizations, and the overall design felt outdated.  
> **Modern Web Design Norms**  
> Today’s websites prioritize minimalist design, clear visual hierarchy, and mobile responsiveness. These features create a smoother, more user-friendly experience, with easy navigation and fast load times.  
> **Conclusion**  
> Visiting an older Amazon site emphasized how much web design has evolved. The shift to simpler, more user-friendly websites is evident, and these design standards are now expected across the internet. This analysis highlighted the importance of usability and accessibility in shaping modern web design."

In terms of strengths, ChatGPT did a good job of breaking down complex ideas by dividing main sections of the response with distinct sub-sections. One of the greatest strengths of the ChatGPT version is creating a very polished and clean response that is concise and easy to read. The information is well-organized and discusses general features of the past Amazon website, discussing the actual experience of looking at the Wayback version. Additionally, the current Amazon website is compared to this older version and highlights broadly true aspects of this current site, specifically the easy navigation and faster load times.

Although there are clear strengths to the ChatGPT response, certain weaknesses are evident especially in terms of actual content. Much of the response is somewhat vague and could easily be applied to most shopping websites. This version lacks specific detail and clear understanding of physical aspects of a website only stating there’s “minimal imagery” or “poor contrast.” Likewise, much of the information isn’t necessarily true and instead comes across as the best guess of how an older website interface would hold up to a newer website interface.

**Note on AI:** Spellcheck and ChatGPT were used in this assignment. ChatGPT was used to generate the previous assignment text prompt.

## [Professional Assessment](#professional-assessment)
#### *Explore an online tutorial, manual, or reference guide/FAQ page. Give it an honest but professional assessment. Describe in your post the aspects of the page(s) that are effective, and explain why.*

I assessed a Singer sewing machine user manual for this reflection, found [here](https://www.singer.com.tr/assets/img/uploads/product-files/dbace176ea069861e0790a36753f030d_en.pdf). 

This guide contained several postive aspects, namely in organization and imagery. The guide has a clear table of contents and is divided into seperate chapters with relevant subsections. Overall, navigation is cohesive and it is easy to find particular subject matter within the guide. In terms of actual content, directions are generally clear and easy to follow and understand. The manual contains relevant imagery throughout it, including in the frorm of labeled diagrams and instructional imagery depicting written steps. These are effective elements as they improve overall user experience while also aiding the reader in understanding the written direction provided.

There are a few drawbacks of the Singer manual, particularly due to the fact that it is missing an index and there are some design and spacing flaws. While overall navigation is well formatted, an index would help readers navigate more specific topics within the guide versus the broader chapters within the table of contents. Additionally, the actual steps (meaning the written instruction and instructional imagery) could be better spaced out from a design perspective so they are more clearly divided through out the document. Removing such visual clutter can help keep the reader from being overwhelmed with information which improves usability of the manual. 

**Note on AI:** Spellcheck through Microsoft Word was used in this assignment.

## [Analyzing Britannica Chatbot](#analyzing-britannica-chatbot)
#### *Analyze a chatbot (e.g., customer service, virtual assistant). Spend at least 5 minutes interacting with it & exploring its functionality. Then, reflect on the bot's: purpose (What is the chatbot designed to do?), functionality (how well does it perform its tasks?), user experience (was it easy to use? What were the strengths and weaknesses?), and context (how does it benefit users and the organization?)*

For this reflection, I analyzed the functionality of the Britannica Chatbot found [here](https://www.britannica.com/chatbot). 

The purpose of this chatbox is to help users find answers to questions which can be found within an encyclopedia. I asked the chat bot several prompts related to historical events and it offered brief but relevant answers. Overall, it was easy to use and doesn't over or under explain topics. Likewise, one of the features I felt was useful and unique to this chatbot was the "Related Questions" feature. Anytime you ask a question, questions pertaining to the topic you've been discussing are offered as additional prompts to ask. 

Functionally, this program was easy to use, well designed, and had useful additional features that enhanced user experience. Responses were concise and on topic, which makes it useful for historical or definitional searches. The only drawback I can think of is that more complex questions aren't always met with in depth explanations, instead producing oversimplistic responses. Overall, this chatbot would be helpful to users looking for accurate and concise responses while also breaking down the massive amounts of information availible on the website.

**Note on AI:** Spellcheck through Microsoft Word was used in this assignment.

## [Reflection on A.I.](#reflection-on-ai)
#### *After you have completed the Chatbot assignment or any assignment using AI for most of the work, reflect on your interaction with this emerging technology: What does AI do well? What does it not do well? What did you have to correct or re-prompt it to modify? What can you know about its training data? What kinds of data was included? What kinds of data was excluded? What do you think the future holds as this technology is used and further advanced?*
For my Chatbot, I created the Tchaikovsky Chatbot
