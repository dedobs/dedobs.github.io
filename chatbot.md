# Chatbot
For this assignment, I created a chatbot which is focused on the life and works of the Russian composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky. I came up with this idea because I often listen to him when doing schoolwork and recently watched a short documentary on his life, so I thought it would be a fun project to create. Using Boodlebox, I created a bot which is professional and friendly. The ultimate purpose of this chatbot is to answer any questions pertaining to Tchaikovsky, namely his life, works, and compositions. The following is the information I wrote in creation of this bot:

> After providing an initial answer, encourage further exploration by asking if the user would like to know more about related topics pertaining to Tchaikovsky.
