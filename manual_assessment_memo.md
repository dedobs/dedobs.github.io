# Manual Assessment Memo

## MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Donald Cummins  
**FROM:** Danielle Dobson  
**SUBJECT:** Brother BM3500 Manual Assessment  
**DATE:** February 13, 2025  

This memo will cover the efficiencies, inefficiencies, and recommended alterations of the Brother BM3500 user manual and can be found [here](https://download.brother.com/welcome/doch000266/bm35002600ug01en.pdf).

This manual contains six separate sections covering topics such as sewing machine use, accessories, special functions, and maintenance information. The starting contents highlights safety considerations and recommended practices for extending the product lifespan. This is followed by sections covering different stitch functions with appropriate pictorial examples of the written instructions. Lastly, the manual is concluded with sections discussing different accessories and applications, maintenance information, and the manual appendix.

There are several effective aspects of this manual which aid in informing the user and improving overall usability:

- **Concise Language**: The manual is written in a professional, technical tone and uses action verbs to emphasize detail.
- **Clear Organization**: The beginning of the document contains an accurate and structured table of contents, highlighting main categories. The index at the end of the document is accurate and alphabetically ordered with relevant topics.
- **Use of Diagrams and Pictures**: Most instructions use demonstrative pictures or diagrams to better explain written steps.
- **Safety Notices and Maintenance**: Key safety issues are clearly and descriptively indicated in relevant areas of the manual. A maintenance guide is provided with detailed upkeep tasks.

Some areas of the manual could benefit from being expanded upon or omitted to improve overall function:

- **Page Design**: Some pages lack white space and are visually cluttered, making the document appear overwhelming or confusing.
- **Excessive Text in Some Areas**: Certain areas of instruction use more detail than necessary, creating a "wall" of text.
- **Brief Troubleshooting Guide**: Although a short troubleshooting guide is included, it is overly brief and placed at the end of the document, away from pertaining topics within the main sections of the manual.

In order to improve the manual's overall usability, I recommend the following alterations:

- **Improve Design Flow**: Reduce the amount of instructions on a single page, creating more white space. Additionally, move non-instruction text to the end of topic sections. Creating a more organized page will improve readability and reduce visual clutter, which can overwhelm the user.
- **Break Up Large Walls of Text**: Omit overly wordy instruction steps; create additional step numbers for necessary instructions. This will increase comprehensibility and make the instructions easier to understand and follow.
- **Improve Troubleshooting Guide**: Expand the troubleshooting area to a full section of the manual, adding relevant diagrams and pictures to instructions. This will aid users in accurately diagnosing and fixing any issues they encounter.
