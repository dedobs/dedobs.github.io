## Modifying Clip Audio

3. To mute the audio completely, click on the **Audio** button and check the **Mute** box.

4. To add a fade effect to the audio, click on the **Audio** button again and use the fade-in or fade-out sliders for smooth transitions.

5. To add background music, drag a music or sound effect from the **Audio** tab into the timeline. You can adjust its position and volume to fit the video.

6. If you want to separate the audio from the video, right-click on the clip in the timeline and select **Detach Audio**. This allows you to move or edit the audio independently of the video.

## Exporting and Sharing Your Movie

After completing your movie and making all necessary adjustments, the final step is to export and share your project. iMovie allows you to export your movie in a variety of formats and resolutions, and share it across different platforms.

> **NOTE:** There are several resolution options you can choose from which will affect export quality. This includes resolutions such as 720p, 1080p, or 4K. Which export resolution you choose will depend on the quality of your project and where you plan to share it.


4. For quality, select the desired level, such as Low, Medium, or High.
