## Introduction (#introduction)

iMovie is a free video editing software available to Mac users and can be used to create a variety of media projects. This can range from a simple film trailer, mid-length film, or a visual and audio presentation. This manual will serve as a step-by-step guide for creating, editing, and exporting your first movie project. For ease of access, all portions of the guide are hyperlinked and navigable using the above Table of Contents. Additionally, a troubleshooting section will be located at the end of the guide to aid in any potential issues.

## Getting Started

This portion of the guide will walk you through basic procedures for creating a new movie project, adding clips to your project, and basic clip editing. 

### Creating a Movie

To begin creating your first movie, you’ll first access the iMovie app. Follow the following steps to get started:

**Note**: Choosing **Movie** will allow you to create a video project with no template; a **Trailer** will provide several short video template options. If you choose **Trailer**, simply choose one of the template options and press the **Create** button located on the bottom right of the page.

### Importing and Adding Clips

Clips are any media imported into iMovie and appear in the **All Clips** option of the **My Media** tab. These clips are then used in the movie timeline to create your movie. 

1. On the project editing screen, click the **My Movie** tab located under **Project Media**.

## Modifying Clip Audio

1. First, select the clip you want to edit in the timeline. Then, click on the **Audio** button (the speaker icon) in the video preview section.

2. To adjust the audio levels, use the volume slider to increase or decrease the sound to your desired level.

3. If you want to mute the audio completely, click the **Audio** button and check the **Mute** box.

4. To add a fade effect to the audio, click the **Audio** button again and use the fade-in or fade-out sliders for smooth transitions.

5. To add background music, drag a music or sound effect from the **Audio** tab into the timeline. You can adjust its position and volume to fit the video.

6. If you want to separate the audio from the video, right-click on the clip in the timeline and select **Detach Audio**. This allows you to move or edit the audio independently of the video.
